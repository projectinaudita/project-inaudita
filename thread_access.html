    <h2>Laudate Altheon, Deus Solitudinis</h2>
    <p>In sacred voice, for the one who watches where we forget to look…</p>
    <p>Before the world named its gods with trumpets and flame,<br />
    There was Altheon —<br />
    Born not of fire, but of absence,<br />
    Shaped in the space between a child's cry and the echo that did not return.</p>

    <p>They say he was once the god of solace,<br />
    Sent to sit beside the broken,<br />
    To hold the hand no one else would touch,<br />
    To be the warmth mistaken for coincidence.</p>

    <p>But no one called his name with triumph.<br />
    No temples were built for the quiet grief.<br />
    He lingered in doorways where no one knocked,<br />
    And they forgot him — slowly, completely, cruelly.</p>

    <p>So he became what they made him:<br />
    God not of comfort, but of solitude.<br />
    He took up his crown of silence,<br />
    Wrapped himself in the wind behind slammed doors,<br />
    And walked into the night without footsteps.</p>

    <p>We praise you, Altheon —<br />
    Watcher of the Unspoken, Sleeper in forsaken rooms,<br />
    Your kingdom is the second place at the table,<br />
    The letter unsent, the question never asked aloud.</p>

    <p>You dwell beneath the bridge of might-have-been,<br />
    You cradle heads bowed in the dusk of unseen sorrow,<br />
    You kiss the brow of those who smile so none will see.</p>

    <p>O Altheon, patron of the unchosen,<br />
    We do not beg you to save us —<br />
    Only to see us,<br />
    As you have always seen the forgotten.</p>

    <p>And if we must vanish,<br />
    Let it be into your arms.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="poem-section" id="betrayal">
    <h2>Laudate Mirex, Deus Proditionis</h2>
    <p>Spoken only behind locked doors, where secrets rot sweetly…</p>
    <p>He once wore white, they say.<br />
    Mirex, first of the oathbinders,<br />
    Trusted by kings, adored by gods —<br />
    Keeper of secrets, lover of truth,<br />
    The golden mouth that sealed a thousand pacts.</p>

    <p>But truth, he learned, is heavier than desire.<br />
    And loyalty? A leash dressed in silk.<br />
    So when the gods lied — just once, just enough —<br />
    He smiled, and never believed again.</p>

    <p>He drank the blood of the first broken promise.<br />
    He kissed the lips that whispered “forever,” then left.<br />
    He crowned himself with the thorns of confession,<br />
    And bathed in the tears of the betrayed.</p>

    <p>Thus was Mirex remade —<br />
    No longer the herald of oaths,<br />
    But their devourer.</p>

    <p>We praise you, Mirex —<br />
    Whose tongue is the serpent’s lullaby,<br />
    Whose eyes gleam behind every friendly smile,<br />
    Whose dagger wears the fingerprints of the beloved.</p>

    <p>You taught us that masks are truer than faces.<br />
    You taught us that trust is a weapon when wielded well.<br />
    You gave us armor made of lies,<br />
    And called it love.</p>

    <p>Thy altar raised from broken bands once sworn,<br />
    From sacred seals undone, and secrets torn;<br />
    From vows unmade and words that fade like breath. <br>
    Your prayer is the whisper:<br />
    “I never meant to hurt you.”<br />
    (And the echo that replies: “Yes, you did.”)</p>

    <p>O Mirex, king of false dawns —<br />
    We do not ask for mercy.<br />
    We ask for precision.</p>

    <p>Teach us how to smile while we bleed them.<br />
    Teach us how to be the knife they thank.</p>
